              I am a game developer with 5+ years of experience and a B.S. in Games from the University of Utah's EAE program (2025).
              I specialize in Unreal Engine, where I've shipped and refined gameplay systems across multiple projects featured in this portfolio.
              My work spans programming, level and game design, and technical art—disciplines I navigate with a producer mindset that aligns teams,
              clarifies scope, and delivers polished, player-focused results. My creative and technical background gives me sharp attention
              to detail and helps me learn new pipelines quickly and efficiently.
            </p>
            <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed">
              My journey into game development started at age 12, building Source engine levels in Hammer—Valve's in-house level editor.
              That spark grew into creating mods across multiple games, developing my own OpenGL graphics renderer, and prototyping extensively in Unity.
              This early hands-on mix of design, engineering, and experimentation wasn't just practice—it fundamentally shaped how I think about systems,
              solve problems, and build games today.
            </p>
            <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed">
              Currently available for new opportunities and excited to collaborate on innovative 
              projects that push the boundaries of interactive entertainment.
